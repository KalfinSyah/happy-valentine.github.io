                <p>Hello love, I admire you, you are a brave and strong person. I speak like this not just to seek your attention, but what I say is true, I witnessed your struggles, from being the leader of class (pjmk) to becoming the chief executive (ketupel). If someone tries to put you down, remember that you are an extraordinary woman. And last one, I just wanted to let you know that I love you more than you know.....</p>
