                <p>Hello, my love. I admire you. You are a brave and strong person. I speak like this not just to seek your attention, but what I say is true. </p>
                <p>I have witnessed your struggles, from being the leader of the class (PJMK) to becoming the Chief Executive (Ketupel). If someone tries to put you down, remember that you are an extraordinary woman. You are an amazing person to me.</p>
                <p>And last thing, I just wanted to say thank you and sorry. Thank you for the love that you give me, and I'm sorry for making you wait for such a long time. Peace.</p>
                <br>
                <p><i>PS: I love you more than you know. <3<i></p>
